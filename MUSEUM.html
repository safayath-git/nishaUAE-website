          <p>Museum of the Future (Arabic: متحف المستقبل)[1] is a landmark devoted to innovative and futuristic ideologies. Located in the Financial District of Dubai, UAE, the Museum of the Future has three main elements: green hill, building, and void.[2] Founded by the Dubai Future Foundation.[3] The Government of the United Arab Emirates opened the museum on 22 February 2022.[4]
            The choice of the date was officially made because 22 February 2022 is a palindrome date.[5]</p>

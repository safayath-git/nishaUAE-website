    <h1>SHEIKH ZAYED GRAND MOSQUE</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20PX;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque being one of the largest mosques in the world and the biggest mosque in the United Arab Emirates, is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Abu Dhabi. 
        This marvel of modern Islamic architecture was built by Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the remembrance of his father. A key feature worth noticing is the world's largest loomed carpet in one of the prayer halls. The mosque is not only a religious site but also 
        serves as an educational and cultural hub. Glamorous architecture combined with exquisite design and pattern of the mosque makes it highly popular among the foreign travellers. </p>
